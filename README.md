# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Pygame.

## Getting Started
Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system. You can install Pygame using the following command:
`pip install pygame`
Clone the repository or download the `tic_tac_toe.py` file to your local machine.
Run the script: `python tic_tac_toe.py`

# How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Two players take turns to place their symbol (Cross or Nought) on an empty cell.
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If the board is full and no player has won, the game is a draw.

## Controls
Click on an empty cell with the left mouse button to make a move.
To exit the game, click the close button on the window.

## Game Logic
The game checks for a winner after each move.
If there is a winner, the game displays the result and stops further moves.
The result is shown in the center of the screen.

## Customization
You can customize the appearance of the game by modifying constants such as CELL_SIZE, GRID_SIZE, BLACK, and WHITE in the script.
